          <h3 class="mb-0">Context</h3>
          <p class="text-dark fs-lg mb-5">In today's fast-paced world, travel has become an integral part of our lives. 
            People are constantly seeking convenient 
            and efficient ways to plan their trips. However, the process of booking flights 
            can often be overwhelming and time-consuming. In such a scenario, a user-friendly and 
            comprehensive flight booking website emerges as a solution to simplify the 
            travel planning process. Our flight booking website 
            serves as a one-stop platform that aggregates flight data from multiple airlines, providing a 
            comprehensive range of options to choose from. <br><br><b>Moreover, having used many airline 
              websites myself over the years, I came to realise that none of them would offer a similar booking 
              experience. It would be easy to assume that the user has a simple goal in mind — find and
               book tickets!</b></p>

              <h3 class="mb-3">Desk Research & competitive benchmark</h3>
          <p class="text-dark fs-lg mb-5">I decided to kick off the research phase by looking into existing 
            studies and gather data which would confirm or refute my assumptions.
            I managed to uncover some interesting findings around user’s goals and pain points.
            I went on to carry out a competitor analysis with 2 different websites: <b>Easyjet </b> and <b> Spicejet </b></p>

               <div>
                <img src="img/easyjet.webp">
               </div>
               <div>
                <p class="text-dark fs-lg mt-4"><b>EasyJet:</b> it offers a good balance between intuitive design and usability. 
                  It is visually pleasing and menus are well designed. However, once flights are selected,
                   we can notice the focus on upselling extras with the abundance of upselling suggestions. 
                   The “Extras” screen cannot be skipped which is rather frustrating. A lot of steps were 
                   also required to register the passenger details.</p>
               </div>
               <p class="text-dark fs-lg mb-5"></p>

               <div class="mt-5">
                <img class="mt-5" src="img/spicejet.png">
               </div>
               <p class="text-dark fs-lg"><b>Spicejet</b> has a loyal suite of domestic travelers in India who choose the 
                brand due to its affordable fares and high frequency of flights. Very few people opt for 
                value-added services.</p>

                <h3 class="mb-0 mt-5">User interviews & Usability Testing</h3>
          <p class="text-dark fs-lg">The next step was to carry out user interviews to gain insights on how the 
            participants would interact with airline apps. Following the interviews, the participants were also 
            asked to participate in usability testing using existing websites. </p>
            <p class="text-dark fs-lg"><b>4 participants were recruited in an A/B testing format, participants were asked to complete the same 
              trip booking on two different websites — EasyJet and Spicejet.</b></p>


               <h5>Pain ponts / Key Findings</h5>
               <ol class="text-dark fs-lg">
                <li>The website is not responsive. Yes, you read it right!</li>
                <li>Usability issues with UI control like location picker, date picker, 
                  color contrast, accessibility, etc.</li>
                <li>Too much information is being asked, which does not have business significance.</li>
                <li>Website navigation is very poor, and information is arranged based on business logic, 
                not the user.</li>
                <li><b>While the users’ goal is to aim for the cheapest fares, they would not mind paying a little 
                  extra for better timings.</b></li>
                <li>The workflow from search to payment is lengthy and takes at least 40 mins for a new user 
                to complete.</li>
                <li>Limited payment options force the user to abandon the journey or continue via phone booking.</li>
               </ol>

               <h3 class="mb-0 mt-5">Current flight booking metrics:</h3>
               <ul class="text-dark fs-lg">
                <li>58% via marketplaces like cleartrip.com, makemytrip.com, yatra.com, and booking.com.</li>
                <li>28% via agents.</li>
                <li>10% via the airline booking website.</li>
                <li>4% via the airline call center.</li>
               </ul>
               <p class="text-dark fs-lg">Also, about 40% of all users who booked on the website ended up calling the phone booking 
                number to verify their booking, complete payment, or understand how they need to book online.</p>

        <p class="text-dark fs-lg">I went on to making low-fidelity grayscale prototypes in Figma once I 
          was satisfied with my sketches. This allows me to make sure that everything I want to add fits 
          inside the specified time period. I designed more than 10
           distinct screen states to demonstrate the process from beginning to end, emphasizing the 
           interactions and material that would be presented.</p>
        <div class="text-center">
          <img src="img/travel-wireframe.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="text-dark fs-lg mt-5">I generated formal handoff wireframe documentation when the designs were 
        completed, documenting in detail every interaction the tool would make. This contained every 
        screen state as well as any other relevant information that the developer could find useful.</p>
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li class="text-dark fs-lg"><b>Homepage & Flight Search Form :</b>The Flight Search Form focuses on the key details 
              required to browse flight options: departure & arrival airports, dates and amount of 
              passengers.</li>

              <li class="text-dark fs-lg"><b>Date Selection :</b> Majority of users would be looking to book 
                the cheapest flights possible. As a result, I wanted to add price information early on in the 
                booking process. While choosing dates, and whether the users have specific dates in mind or 
                only intend to browse, I incorporated the flights average price for one passenger for each day.</li>

                <li class="text-dark fs-lg"><b>Flight Selection :</b>The research showed that users had 
                  different expectations on how the flight results should appear. I chose to display the 
                  flights by time of departure as a default option as users are usually willing to make 
                  a trade off between price and timings when making their selection. </li>

                    can also look irrelevant. For those reasons, I kept the form as simple as possible 
                    and only asked for titles and names. The email address is required for the main booker 
                    in order to get a digital receipt. </li>
