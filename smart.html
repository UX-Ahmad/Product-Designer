          <p class="text-dark fs-lg">'Smart' is a smart home app that aims to integrate monitoring and controlling 
            of smart home appliances from a single app. It provides a more efficient way of managing member 
            accounts and to control devices seamlessly. Smart is designed keeping the end user in mind.</p> 

            <ul class="text-dark fs-lg">
              <li>Our client is a start-up from the US which has plans to launch their new product range in 
                Europe later this year.</li>
                <li>They have developed a range of smart home devices such as smart plugs, lights, sensors, 
                  cameras, alarms etc., which are targeted at high-end consumers.</li>
                  <li>The company is interested in creating an interface that helps users to easily access 
                    and control these products from a mobile app.</li>
                  <li>My job was to design an application that makes connecting, controlling and using 
                    smart home devices useful, relevant and enjoyable.</li>

            <h3 class="mb-lg-4">Problem Statement</h3>
            <p class="mb-lg-4 fs-lg text-dark">" Smart home residents tend to own multiple smart devices 
              and want them to work together under a single app. They also want an option where devices 
              could be scheduled to run by the user and be automated accordingly. An another feature most 
              of them desired was sharing the access of devices and to have admin control over them. " </p>

        <p class="text-dark fs-lg">We believe that by developing an app that allows our users to manage and control 
          their devices from anywhere, we will make their experience more desirable, usable and convenient. We will 
          know this to be true when we see these users use this app over the smart device’s partner app. </p>

                room starts going off.”</li>
              <li>“You can’t properly set up songs and stuff on your phone on that day and then do it through 
                the phone; you kind of have to ask Alexa what to do and then you can just skip tracks and 
                things on the phone.”</li>

        <p class="text-dark fs-lg">Brain Writing is where each person writes down or sketches the beginning of 
          an idea silently on a Post-it. This could be as simple as a single word or a shape. After three minutes, the person passes the paper to his neighbour, who continues the idea. This repeats around the circle until it gets all the way back
          around to its originator.</p>

        <p class="text-dark fs-lg">I managed to create a mobile app which will allow our users to control 
          multiple smart home devices all from one app including some new features that the main competitors 
          do not have such as discovering and buying additional products through the app. These features should 
          significantly increase the visibility and opportunity to discover new smart home products.</p>
          <p class="text-dark fs-lg">This was a great brief and thoroughly enjoyed learning about different 
            benefits and features of different smart home devices on the market today — looking forward 
            to continued releases.</p>
